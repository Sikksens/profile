            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                I’m a passionate Junior Web Developer with a strong foundation in front-end technologies like HTML, CSS,
                and JavaScript.
                I enjoy building responsive, user-friendly websites and learning new tools that enhance web performance
                and design.
                My goal is to continue growing as a developer, contributing to meaningful projects, and expanding my
                skills in both front-end and back-end development.
            </p>

            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>
                I’ve worked on several web development projects, both independently and collaboratively, creating clean,
                modern, and accessible websites.
                My experience includes developing personal and client-based projects using frameworks like React and
                Bootstrap,
                integrating APIs, and maintaining version control with Git and GitHub. I’m also comfortable working in
                agile environments and adapting quickly to new technologies.
